Once upon a time in a lush orchard, there was a tree that bore the juiciest apples.

One sunny afternoon, a girl named Mia ventured into the orchard.

Throughout the day, Mia and her friends explored the orchard, climbing trees and picking more apples.

As the sun began to set, Mia decided to share her magical apples with her family.
